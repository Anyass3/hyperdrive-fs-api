# hyperdrive-x

A hyperdrive-next with extra features, somewhat similar to the late hyperdrive 10.

> The new https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperdrive-next is focused more on file sharing.

It's just an extension is of the new hyperdrive-next to include some/most hyperdrive 10 apis to atleast satisfy my [hyp-files-app](https://github.com/Anyass3/hyp-files-app) project.

Also try to type most/all of it
