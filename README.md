# hyperdrive-fs-api
hyyperdrive with important file-system apis
> the new https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperdrive-next doesn't use the nodejs fs system apis

The idea is to extend the hyperdrive-next to include some/most fs system apis to atleast satisfy my [hyp-files-app](https://github.com/Anyass3/hyp-files-app) project.

Also try to type most/all of it
